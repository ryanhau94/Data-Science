<!--
    Every image should have all four attributes
    alt: provide the description whenever the image cannot be seen (for example: when blind people use text reader)
    Defining width and height brings better user experience.

    The order of the attributes does not matter in HTML.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="description" width="400" height="300">
